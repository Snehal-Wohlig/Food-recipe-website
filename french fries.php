    <p> <strong> Step 1- Pressure cooking tomatoes</strong></p>
    <p>Take chopped tomatoes, green chili, red chili powder and salt in a pressure cooker. Mix well.
       Cover it with lid, put the weight on. Turn the heat on medium.
        Let it whistle 2 times. The turn off the stove.
        Once the pressure is released from the cooker. Open the lid.
        Make smooth puree out of it using grinder or blender.</p>

    <p> <strong>Step 2-Steaming the vegetables</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile tomatoes are cooking, cook the veggies.
Chop them and wash them well.
For steaming, add glassful of water in a pan. Put the steamer in. Cover it let the water come to a boil.
Add prepared veggies except capsicum. Cover it and let it steam on medium heat for 15 minutes.
During the last 3 minutes, add capsicum. Again cover it and cook till veggies are done. Basically, I steamed for 12 minutes then added capsicum, steam for again 3 minutes. So it took me total 15 mins.
check the doneness by inserting a knife into potato.
Once done remove it from the pan and keep it aside.</p>


<p> <strong>Step 3-Making veg makhanwala recipe: </strong></p>
<p>Heat the butter in a pan on medium heat.
Once hot, add ginger paste and garlic paste. Saute for a minute.
Add prepared tomato puree. Let it simmer till all the moisture evaporates and it becomes like a thick paste.
if it splutters a lot, you can partially cover the pan.
Then add remaining red chili powder and coriander powder. Mix well and cook for a minute.
Then add water to make the gravy consistency. Let it simmer for 4-5 minutes.
Then add steamed veggies. Mix well and cook for 1-2 minutes.
then add garam masala and crushed kasoori methi. Mix well.
Lastly add heavy cream.
Stir well and turn off the stove.
Vegetable makhani is ready to serve.</p>
